# Cost-Effectiveness of a Workplace Ban on Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Sales

Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) such as carbonated sodas are associated with an elevated risk of multiple chronic diseases. An SSB workplace sales ban has been introduced by several U.S. employers to discourage employees from consuming SSBs. Whether an SSB workplace sales ban will ultimately be cost-effective for employers and society, and how cost-effectiveness is affected by longer-term impact scenarios, are not known. We constructed and applied a microsimulation model of national employee populations, including rates of chronic disease-related costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from employer and healthcare system perspectives.
